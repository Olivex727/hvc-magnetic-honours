# HVC and Magnetic Fields POSSUM Project
Code repository for my (Olivia's) Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Honours Project

## Directories and files of interest

The main project's code is collated into a series of python and jupyter notebook files.

The "project" directory is where the most important code modules are held.

The "standard_modules" directory is where additional functions and modules are stored and used.

The "data_catalog" is where the various survey data is stored.

In the main directory, there are a few files of interest:
- main.py (Runs the main project - can be called directly)
- project.ipynb (A notebook acting as a guide to using the code)
- README.md (Project README)
- __init__.py (Project initialisation)

All other files and directories present contain code not directly used in the final product. Most of it is the original investigation work.

## Large files

Due to GitHub size limits, images pertaining to the HI sky, H-alpha sky, and the interpolated foreground FITS are not uploaded to github. This includes effectively all files in data_catalog and data_preprocessed. In future commits I will list which files are missing from the repository for you to download if needed.

## Coding permissions

This repository should only be edited by myself (Olivia), Craig Anderson, and Naomi McClure-Griffiths. If you find that you can edit documents in this repository, please notify me and do not submit any commits.

Anyone interested in this project comment on, review, or read this code, making notes on GitHub or the project's slack page.

Feel free to fork or pull this repository if you find any code interesting for your own research purposes. Do note that this repository is under an MIT liscence.

Be mindful when forking that this repository will be regularly updated until the end of this year.
